# RNA_Splicing
Models and analyses related to RNA splicing performed in Chris Burge's lab at MIT.

Abbreviations: 3SS = 3' Splice Site, PPT = Polypyrimidine Tract

Most scripts require intronic sequence parses near the splice site vs. deep intronic (control).

HMM_PPT_Model is a two-state (PPT vs. Random) hidden-Markov model of the 3' splice site. 
Heuristic_PPT_Model is a rule based model to identify PPTs
