# RNA_Splicing
RNA splicing models and analyses performed at MIT. 

Abbreviations: 3SS = 3' Splice Site, PPT = Polypyrimidine Tract

HMM_PPT_Model is a two-state (PPT vs. Random) hidden-Markov model of the 3' splice site.

Heuristic_PPT_Model is a rule-based model to identify PPTs 

MLP_NN_SF3B1 is a multi-layer perceptron neural network to predict splice sites that could be sensitive to cryptic splicing upon SF3B1 mutation.
